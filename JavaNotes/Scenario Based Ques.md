1. Your Spring Boot application is experiencing performance issues under high load. What are the steps you would take to identify and address the performance?
   

2. What strategies would you use to optimize the performance of a Spring Boot application?
   Let’s say my Spring Boot application is taking too long to respond to user requests. I could:
   • Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
   • Optimize database queries to reduce the load on the database.
   • Use asynchronous methods for operations like sending emails.
   • Load Balancer if traffic is high
   • Optimize the time complexity of the code
   • Use webFlux to handle a large number of concurrent connections.

3. scheduled jobs in your spring boot application is running twice in production even though you deployed only once. What might be happening?

4. So let's say your rest API allows file uploads but users complain about large files failing silently. How would you debug and fix this?

5. So uh let's say your API endpoints returns an empty JSON response even though that DB has data.

6. So in your system you have 10 spring boot microservices. Okay. Managing configuration separately has been painful. Right. Managing configurations separately has been painful. How would you handle centralized config management?

7. so how are static variables stored in memory compared to instance variable?
