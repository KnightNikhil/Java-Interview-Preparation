1. Your Spring Boot application is experiencing performance issues under high load. What are the steps you would take to identify and address the performance?
   

2. What strategies would you use to optimize the performance of a Spring Boot application?
   Let’s say my Spring Boot application is taking too long to respond to user requests. I could:
   • Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
   • Optimize database queries to reduce the load on the database.
   • Use asynchronous methods for operations like sending emails.
   • Load Balancer if traffic is high
   • Optimize the time complexity of the code
   • Use webFlux to handle a large number of concurrent connections.
