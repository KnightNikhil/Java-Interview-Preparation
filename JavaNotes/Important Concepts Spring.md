## @Cacheable
The `@Cacheable` annotation in Spring is used to **automatically cache the result of a method** so that future requests with the same parameters return the cached value instead of executing the method again. This feature is designed for improving application performance, especially for expensive or frequently called methods[1][3][5][7].

### How @Cacheable Works

- When a method annotated with `@Cacheable` is called, Spring checks if the result for the given input is already in the cache.
- If the cache contains the value, Spring returns it directly and **skips method execution**.
- If the value is not cached, the method executes, and the return value is stored in the specified cache for future use.
- Example:
```java
@Cacheable("books")
public Book findBookByIsbn(String isbn) {
    // Simulate slow DB operation
}
```
- The next call with the same `isbn` will read from the cache "books" and not re-execute the method[1][3][7].

### Key Features and Parameters

- **cacheNames/value**: Name(s) of the cache to use (`@Cacheable("myCache")`).
- **key**: Customizes how the cache key is generated, using Spring EL (`@Cacheable(value="books", key="#isbn")`).
- **condition**: Cache the result only if the condition is true (`@Cacheable(value="users", condition="#age>18")`).
- **unless**: Prevent caching if this condition becomes true (`@Cacheable(value="orders", unless="#result.total < 100")`).
- **sync**: Controls synchronization for cache lookups to avoid simultaneous slow method executions[1][5][7].

### Advanced Usage and Best Practices

- Can be applied at method or class level.
- Supports multiple caches (`@Cacheable({"books", "isbns"})`). Spring updates all caches accordingly[1].
- Can be combined with other cache annotations like `@CachePut` (always run and update cache) and `@CacheEvict` (remove items from cache).
- Works best with idempotent and side-effect free methods.
- Beans must be managed by Spring (do not instantiate with `new`, as Spring AOP proxying is required)[6].

| Aspect                  | Description                                                            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                 | Avoid redundant computation; use cache for repeated calls.              |
| Usage                   | Simple: `@Cacheable("cacheName")`; result stored by method params.      |
| Key customization       | Use SpEL for cache key expressions.                                    |
| Conditional caching     | Use `condition`, `unless` for more control.                            |
| Cache invalidation      | Use with `@CacheEvict` to clear or update cache when data changes.      |
| Limitations             | Only works on Spring-managed beans, not on new object instances.        |

In summary, **`@Cacheable` is a declarative, annotation-driven caching mechanism** in Spring for optimizing application performance by caching expensive or commonly requested operation results[1][3][5][7].The `@Cacheable` annotation in Spring is used for declarative, annotation-based caching—meaning it allows methods to have their results automatically stored in a cache so later calls with the same parameters return the cached result without executing the method again[1][3][5][7].

### How @Cacheable Works

- When a method annotated with `@Cacheable` is invoked, Spring checks the cache for the result associated with the given input (the cache key, usually derived from method parameters).
- If the value is present, it is returned from the cache, and the method is **not** executed.
- If it is not present, the method is executed, and the return value is stored in the specified cache for future use.
- Example:
  ```java
  @Cacheable("books")
  public Book findBookByIsbn(String isbn) { 
      // slow db call here
  }
  ```
- Every subsequent call with the same ISBN will return the cached Book from the "books" cache, skipping method execution[1][3][7].

### Key Features

- **cacheNames/value**: Specifies the name(s) of the cache(s) to use.
- **key**: SpEL (Spring Expression Language) to customize the cache key (`@Cacheable(value="books", key="#isbn")`).
- **condition/unless**: Control when results should be cached or not (great for conditional or negative caching).
- **sync**: To synchronize cache loading, avoiding parallel computation for the same key[1][7].
- Caching works transparently for Spring-managed beans only—if instantiated using `new`, caching will not work as there's no proxy interception[6].

### Best Practices

- Use on read-heavy, expensive operations.
- Combine with `@CacheEvict` (to remove stale entris) and `@CachePut` (to update cache without skipping method execution) as needed.
- For advanced needs, combine multiple annotations using `@Caching`, or create composed meta-annotations[1][3][5].

## Scheduled Tasks / Cron Jobs in Java
A **cron job in Java** is a scheduled task that executes code at regular, specific intervals (e.g., daily, hourly). In interview settings, you should focus on how cron jobs can be implemented using core Java and with frameworks like Spring, as well as how cron expressions control scheduling[1][2][4][6][9].

### 1. Cron Job Concepts

- Inspired by Unix “cron”, a utility that schedules shell/script execution.
- In Java, cron jobs are used for automated work like report generation, periodic data cleanup, backups, or notifications.
- Cron jobs provide timing control using “cron expressions”: formatted strings indicating minutes, hours, days, months, weekdays, etc. Example: `"0 0 12 * * ?"` for noon daily[3][9].

### 2. Implementing Cron Jobs

#### A. Using Quartz Scheduler (Enterprise Standard)
- Quartz is a popular Java library for scheduling jobs using cron expressions.
- Define a Job class by implementing `org.quartz.Job`:
  ```java
  public class MyJob implements Job {
      @Override
      public void execute(JobExecutionContext context) {
          // business logic here
      }
  }
  ```
- Set up a trigger with a cron expression:
  ```java
  CronTrigger trigger = new CronTrigger("cronTrigger", "group1", "0 0/1 * * * ?");
  ```
- Associate the job and trigger with a scheduler:
  ```java
  Scheduler scheduler = new StdSchedulerFactory().getScheduler();
  scheduler.scheduleJob(jobDetail, trigger);
  scheduler.start();
  ```
- Quartz handles the execution, persistence, and repeat scheduling[4][2][7].

#### B. Using Spring @Scheduled (Modern, Framework-based)
- Spring Boot/Framework enables easy cron scheduling via annotations.
- Annotate the main class with `@EnableScheduling`:
  ```java
  @SpringBootApplication
  @EnableScheduling
  public class DemoApp { ... }
  ```
- Annotate a method with `@Scheduled`:
  ```java
  @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 12 * * ?")
  public void scheduledTask() {
      // Executes daily at 12 noon
  }
  ```
- Spring manages execution and timing, no manual scheduler code needed.
- Can use fixed delays, intervals, or cron expressions for flexibility[1][6][9].

### 3. Running Java Apps as System Cron Jobs

- Outside of Java frameworks, the OS “cron” tool can schedule a JAR or class file:
  ```
  * * * * * java -cp /path/app.jar com.example.App
  ```
- This is set in the crontab of Unix/Linux systems and runs the Java code in intervals specified by the five fields (minute, hour, day, month, weekday)[1].

### 4. Interview Key Points

| Aspect                 | Description                                                                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cron Expression        | String format for schedule control, e.g., `"0 0 * * * ?"` for every midnight              |
| Quartz                 | Enterprise job scheduler, flexible cron/job management, persistent                       |
| Spring @Scheduled      | Annotation-driven, simple integration, no external scheduler required                     |
| System Cron            | Uses OS-level cron to trigger Java programs, not controlled in Java source                |
| Use Cases              | Reports, reminders, batch jobs, archival, periodic data sync                              |
| Pitfalls/Considerations| Timezones, error handling, job overlap, persistence if scheduling in distributed systems  |

A cron job in Java is most commonly implemented using Spring’s `@Scheduled` (for simplicity) and Quartz Scheduler (for enterprise control), with execution managed by cron expressions that specify exactly when the code should run[1][2][4][6][7][9].
