âœ… Critical Topics to Learn (Advanced Microservices)

ðŸ”¹ 1. API Versioning Strategies

2.	How to manage breaking changes

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 2. Microservice Security (Beyond Auth Gateway)
1.	OAuth2 with Keycloak / Auth0

3.	Role-based access control (RBAC)
4.	Method-level security (@PreAuthorize, @Secured)

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 3. Distributed Transactions
1.	Saga Pattern (Orchestration vs Choreography)
2.	2PC (Not preferred, but understand it)
3.	Event-driven consistency (Kafka-based saga)

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 4. Event-Driven Architecture
1.	Apache Kafka (you already know this!)
2.	Message formats (Avro/JSON)
3.	Idempotency, retries, and ordering
4.	Dead-letter queues

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 5. Database Design in Microservices
1.	Database per service

ðŸ”¹ 6. Service Mesh (Intro Level)
1.	What is Istio / Linkerd
2.	Sidecar proxy (Envoy)
3.	Difference from API Gateway

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 7. Microservice Observability

Youâ€™re already learning Zipkin and ELK; also learn:
1.	Prometheus + Grafana for custom metrics
2.	Micrometer integration with Spring Boot

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 8. Performance and Scalability
1.	Horizontal scaling
2.	Load balancing with Ribbon (deprecated) or service discovery-based LB
3.	Rate limiting strategies (fixed window, sliding window)

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 9. Deployment Strategies (Cloud & DevOps)
1.	Dockerize microservices
2.	Kubernetes basics (Pods, Services, ConfigMaps)
3.	Helm charts (optional but useful)
4.	CI/CD overview with GitHub Actions or Jenkins

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 10. Design Patterns for Microservices
1.	Circuit Breaker (youâ€™ve covered)
2.	API Gateway Pattern
3.	Strangler Fig Pattern (legacy migration)
4.	CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
