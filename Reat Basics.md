*  useContext
*  useCallback & useMemo
*  useReducer


⸻

✅ 3. Component Design
* Functional component structure

* Navigation (useNavigate)
* Nested routes

⸻

✅ 5. Styling Approaches

* Redux, Zustand, Recoil, Jotai

⸻

✅ 7. API Integration
* Fetching data using:
* fetch, axios, useEffect

⸻

✅ 8. Form Handling & Validation
* Controlled vs uncontrolled components
* Handling input values and submission
* Basic validation
* Awareness of libraries like:
* react-hook-form, Formik, Yup (not mandatory, but useful)

⸻

✅ 9. Code Quality & Best Practices
