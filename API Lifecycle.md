# Enterprise API Lifecycle & Key Concepts

## 1. API Creation

- **Build REST APIs** using Spring Boot.
- Define endpoints with `@RestController`.
- Implement a Service Layer for business logic.
- Connect to databases using Spring Data JPA.
- **Secure APIs** with:
  - JWT tokens
  - OAuth2
  - API Keys
- Apply role-based access control using `@PreAuthorize`.
- Write unit and integration tests.

---

## 2. API Deployment

- Package APIs as `.jar` files using Spring Boot.
- Deploy to:
  - On-premises servers
  - Cloud platforms (AWS EC2, ECS, Azure, GCP)
- Use embedded servers like **Tomcat**.

---

## 3. Middleware & Security Layers

### API Gateway (Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway, AWS API Gateway)

- Acts as a single entry point.
- Handles:
  - Routing to backend services
  - Authentication/Authorization
  - Load balancing
  - Throttling (Rate Limiting)
  - Logging & Monitoring

### Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd)

- Controls internal service-to-service traffic.
- Features:
  - Load Balancing
  - Retry Policies
  - Circuit Breaker
  - Traffic Shifting
  - Secure Communication (mTLS)
  - Observability & Tracing

### Firewall & Security

- **Security Groups**: Instance-level firewalls.
- **Network ACLs**: Subnet-level controls.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Blocks SQL Injection, XSS, etc.

---

## 4. Observability & Monitoring

- Spring Boot Actuator (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`)
- Centralized logs with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
- Distributed tracing with Zipkin or Jaeger

# Follow-up Questions & Answers

## API Development & Spring Boot

- **How do you secure APIs?**
  - Spring Security, JWT tokens, OAuth2, Role-based access
- **Why embedded Tomcat?**
  - Simplifies deployment, container-friendly
- **Exception Handling?**
  - Use `@ControllerAdvice`, `@ExceptionHandler`
- **Monolith vs Microservices?**
  - Monolith = Single unit, tightly coupled; Microservices = Independent, scalable

## API Gateway

- **How does API Gateway handle throttling?**
  - Throttling limits the number of API requests a client can make within a specific time window to prevent abuse or overload.
  - In API Gateway:
    - Throttling is configured using Rate Limiting filters or plugins.
    - Limits can be set per IP, per User, or per API route.
    - Requests beyond the allowed limit receive HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests).
  - Example Spring Cloud Gateway config:
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        gateway:
          routes:
            - id: demo-service
              uri: http://localhost:8080
              predicates:
                - Path=/api/**
              filters:
                - name: RequestRateLimiter
                  args:
                    redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate: 10  # 10 requests per second
                    redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity: 20
    ```
  - Backend integration often uses Redis to track request counts in distributed setups.

- **Can you implement authentication at API Gateway level?**
  - Yes, API Gateway is the ideal place to handle authentication.
  - Common approaches:
    - JWT Token Validation at Gateway
    - OAuth2 Token Verification
    - API Key Validation
  - Benefits:
    - Stops unauthorized traffic early
    - Shields backend microservices
    - Centralized security enforcement
    - Reduces redundant auth logic in each service
  - Example filter:
    ```java
    @Bean
    public GlobalFilter authenticationFilter() {
      return (exchange, chain) -> {
        String token = exchange.getRequest().getHeaders().getFirst("Authorization");
        if (token == null || !isValid(token)) {
          exchange.getResponse().setStatusCode(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);
          return exchange.getResponse().setComplete();
        }
        return chain.filter(exchange);
      };
    }
    ```

- **How does API Gateway handle failures of downstream services?**
  - Failures include service crashes, timeouts, high latency, etc.
  - Gateway can handle them using resilience patterns:
    - Circuit Breaker: Stops sending traffic to failing services temporarily
    - Fallback Mechanisms: Returns a default response if service fails
    - Retries: Retries failed requests with backoff strategy
    - Time-outs: Prevents gateway from hanging indefinitely
  - Example Circuit Breaker config:
    ```yaml
    filters:
      - name: CircuitBreaker
        args:
          name: myCircuit
          fallbackUri: forward:/fallback
    ```

- **Zuul vs Spring Cloud Gateway?**

  | Feature           | Zuul 1.x (Netflix OSS) | Spring Cloud Gateway         |
    |-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
  | Underlying Tech   | Servlet-based, Blocking IO | Reactive, Non-Blocking (WebFlux) |
  | Performance       | Lower, blocking        | Higher throughput, Reactive |
  | Built on          | Netflix OSS Zuul       | Spring WebFlux              |
  | Extensibility     | Custom filters         | Advanced filters, better integration |
  | Recommended for   | Legacy apps            | Modern Microservices        |

## Service Mesh vs API Gateway: Deep Dive (Istio, Linkerd)

- **Why do we need Service Mesh when we already have API Gateway?**

  | Feature             | API Gateway                          | Service Mesh                             |
    |---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
  | Scope               | North-South Traffic (external â†” internal) | East-West Traffic (internal â†” internal)  |
  | Primary Role        | Entry point for external clients      | Manage internal microservice communication |
  | Concerns Handled    | Authentication, Rate Limiting, Routing, Aggregation | Service Discovery, Load Balancing, Resilience (Retries, Circuit Breakers), Security (mTLS), Observability |
  | Example             | Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, NGINX    | Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect           |

  - API Gateway **cannot manage traffic between internal microservices**.
  - Service Mesh provides **fine-grained control, telemetry, security, and fault-tolerance** for East-West traffic.
  - Large, distributed systems need visibility, control, and security beyond what an API Gateway provides.

- **How does Service Mesh manage retries and circuit breakers?**
  - Retries & Circuit Breakers are managed via sidecar proxies (e.g., Envoy in Istio).
  - **Retries Example (Istio):**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
    kind: VirtualService
    spec:
      http:
        - route:
            - destination:
                host: reviews
          retries:
            attempts: 3
            perTryTimeout: 2s
            retryOn: gateway-error,connect-failure,refused-stream
    ```
  - **Circuit Breaker Example (Istio):**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
    kind: DestinationRule
    spec:
      host: reviews
      trafficPolicy:
        connectionPool:
          http:
            http1MaxPendingRequests: 1
            maxRequestsPerConnection: 1
        outlierDetection:
          consecutive5xxErrors: 5
          interval: 10s
          baseEjectionTime: 30s
          maxEjectionPercent: 50
    ```
  - Without Service Mesh, implementing these requires custom logic in each service.

- **How does mTLS work in a Service Mesh?**
  - mTLS (Mutual TLS) ensures:
    - **Encryption:** Secures data-in-transit.
    - **Authentication:** Both client and server verify each other's identities.
    - **Authorization:** Policies based on service identities.
  - mTLS is handled by sidecar proxies (e.g., Envoy).
  - Certificates are issued & rotated by the Mesh's Control Plane (e.g., Istio's istiod).
  - Developers do not need to modify application code for TLS.
  - **Traffic Flow with mTLS:**
    ```
    [Service A] â†’ [Sidecar Proxy A] â‡„ (mTLS encrypted) â‡„ [Sidecar Proxy B] â†’ [Service B]
    ```

- **What overhead does Service Mesh introduce?**
  - **Resource Overhead:** Additional CPU & Memory for sidecars.
  - **Latency Overhead:** Each request passes through two proxies (adds sub-ms to a few ms).
  - **Operational Complexity:** Mesh config, certificate management, upgrades.
  - **Learning Curve:** Teams must learn Mesh concepts and tools.
  - **Trade-off:** Small/simple apps may not need Mesh; large-scale systems benefit from resilience, observability, and security.

- **Quick Comparison Table:**

  | Concern               | API Gateway       | Service Mesh           |
    |----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
  | External Traffic Mgmt| âœ… Yes            | ðŸš« No                  |
  | Internal Traffic Mgmt| ðŸš« No             | âœ… Yes                 |
  | Retries/Circuit Breakers| Basic (limited) | Advanced, fine-grained |
  | mTLS Security        | Limited, manual   | Transparent, automated |
  | Observability        | Entry-level       | Deep metrics, tracing  |
  | Overhead             | Minimal           | CPU/Memory/Latency     |

## Firewall & Security

- **How are Security Groups different from NACLs?**

  | Feature                   | Security Groups                              | Network ACLs (NACLs)                          |
    |---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
  | Scope                     | Instance level                               | Subnet level                                  |
  | Traffic Direction         | Stateful (return traffic allowed)            | Stateless (return traffic rules needed)        |
  | Rule Evaluation           | All rules evaluated collectively (allow)      | Rules evaluated in order (numbered)            |
  | Default Behavior          | Deny all by default, need explicit allow      | Deny all by default, need explicit allow       |
  | Type of Rules Supported   | Only Allow rules                             | Allow and Deny rules                           |
  | Common Usage              | Instance-level control for EC2/ENI           | Subnet-level control for broader filtering     |
  | Example                   | Allow port 22 (SSH) from specific IP to EC2  | Deny all traffic from specific IP to subnet    |

  - **Security Groups:** Act like virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
  - **NACLs:** Act like firewalls for entire subnets within a VPC.

- **Where would you place WAF in your architecture?**

  - **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** protects web-facing applications from attacks like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
  - **Placement Options:**
    1. In front of Application Load Balancer (ALB): Common AWS setup, protects before EC2/containers.
    2. In front of CloudFront Distribution (CDN Layer): Global edge protection, ideal for static/global apps.
    3. Third-party WAF appliances: For on-premises or hybrid setups.
  - **Example Architecture:**
    ```
    User Request â€“> CloudFront (WAF integrated) â€“> ALB (WAF integrated) â€“> EC2/Containers â€“> Application
    ```
  - **Why Place WAF There?**
    - Stops malicious traffic before it reaches your application.
    - Reduces load on backend servers.
    - Centralized security policy enforcement.
    - Protects against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

- **How do you handle DDoS protection?**

  1. **AWS Shield:** Automatic DDoS protection (Standard/Advanced).
  2. **CloudFront CDN:** Edge locations absorb traffic, reduce origin exposure.
  3. **WAF:** Blocks, rate-limits, or challenges suspicious traffic.
  4. **Auto Scaling:** Adds resources to absorb attacks.
  5. **Network ACLs & Security Groups:** Filter traffic at subnet/instance levels.
  6. **Route 53 DNS Failover:** Distributes/redirects traffic during attack.
  7. **Third-Party DDoS Solutions:** Cloudflare, Akamai, etc.

  - **Example Defense in Depth:**
    ```
    User â€“> CloudFront (Edge Protection) â€“> WAF â€“> ALB (Shield/WAF) â€“> EC2 Auto Scaling â€“> Application
    ```
  - **Summary:**
    - DDoS protection is multi-layered.
    - Combine AWS native tools (Shield, WAF, CloudFront) with best practices (Auto Scaling, rate limiting).
    - Regular monitoring, alerting, and incident response are critical.

## Observability & Monitoring

- **Spring Boot Actuator:** Provides health and metrics endpoints.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Tracks requests across microservices, helps debugging.
- **Alerts:** Prometheus alerts, CloudWatch alarms, Slack/Email notifications.

## Enterprise Patterns
