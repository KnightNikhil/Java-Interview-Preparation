`ROADMAP`

✅ 1. Core Interfaces and Hierarchy

Understand the interface hierarchy and what each offers:
* Collection
* List → ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack
* Set → HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
* Queue → PriorityQueue, Deque, ArrayDeque, LinkedList
* Map (not part of Collection but crucial)
* HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable, ConcurrentHashMap, WeakHashMap

🧠 Interview Expectation: Be able to draw the hierarchy and explain use cases.

✅ 2. Internal Working & Time Complexity
* Table where all the collections are stored with their
* * Internal Structure, 
* * Time complexity of Internal Structure, 
* * Insert
, 
* * Delete

✅ 3. Ordering and Duplicates
* Table with following column
* * Maintains Order?
* * Allows Duplicates?
* * Null value allowed
* * Throws exception?

✅ 4. Thread-Safety
* Not thread-safe: ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet
* Thread-safe:
* Legacy: Vector, Hashtable
* Modern: Collections.synchronizedList(), ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList
* Use ConcurrentHashMap in high-concurrency apps.

✅ 5. Fail-Fast vs Fail-Safe Iterators
* Fail-Fast: ArrayList, HashMap — throws ConcurrentModificationException
* Fail-Safe: ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList — safe but not real-time data

✅ 6. Java 8+ Enhancements
* Streams API:
* filter, map, collect, sorted, forEach
* Functional Interfaces: Function, Consumer, Predicate
* Map.forEach, Map.computeIfAbsent(), removeIf() etc.

✅ 7. Comparisons and Custom Sorting
* Comparable<T> vs Comparator<T>
* Lambda expressions for sorting
* Collections.sort(list, comparator)
* TreeMap and TreeSet with custom comparators

✅ 8. Advanced Topics
* Load Factor, Capacity in HashMap
* Resize / Rehash logic
* Difference between identity-based and equals-based maps: HashMap vs IdentityHashMap
* WeakHashMap and its use with garbage collection
* EnumMap, EnumSet for performance with Enums
* Deque vs Queue, Stack deprecation


✅ 9. Real-World Scenarios & Design
* Which collection to use when?
* Replace List<Optional<T>> with filters
* Use LinkedHashMap for LRU cache
* Choosing the right Set or Map for memory-sensitive or speed-critical applications
